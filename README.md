Simple create, read, update and delete java form built using intellij MySQL & XAMPP

After you download and setup intellij and XAMPP, you will need to go to PHPmyadmin and create a new database called "DMProducts" with a products table and pid as the primary key and name,price,qty columns. If you want to create your own name make sure to update the code to match.

note - pid,price,qty should be type int(11) and name should be type varchar(255)
